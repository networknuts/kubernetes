Step 1 - User creating his openssl key and converting it into .csr from his workstation machine 

# openssl genrsa -out user.key 2048
# openssl req -new -key user.key -out user.csr -subj "/CN=username"

Step 2 - User submit his key and csr to CA (on manager)

# scp user.key user.csr login@manager:

Step 3 - Root CA will convert his .csr into .crt and send the .crt back to user

# openssl x509 -req -in user.csr -CA /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt -CAkey /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial -out user.crt -days 365

# scp user.crt login@workstation:

Step 4 - Now user will create a .kube directory under his home and copy the config file sent by root CA

Step 5 - User also needs to install kubectl on his workstation

# sudo snap install kubectl --classic

#######

Once this is done root CA will create user credentials on kubernetes manager and limit user to a namespace
dev, for this example

# kubectl config set-credentials user --client-certificate=user.crt --client-key=user.key
# kubectl config set-context user-context --cluster=kubernetes --namespace=dev --user=user

######

Finally a role and role binding will be attached with user
