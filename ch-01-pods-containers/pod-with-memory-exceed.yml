# here using the stress utility and using args
# we are trying to claim 275MiB of memory while
# running the pod. Which should fail, as its beyond
# the max limit of 250MiB
#
# OOM killer (Out Of Memory) will be activated and
# kill the pod
#
# create namespace learning -
# kubectl create namespace learning
#
# run the pod
# kubectl create -f pod-with-memory-exceed.yml

# check the pod
# kubectl get pods
