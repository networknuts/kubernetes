# DevOps Interview Knowledge Base

**Version:** 1.0 (First Release)

This repository provides a well‑curated collection of real‑world DevOps interview questions and concise, practical answers. It is designed for professionals with **5+ years of experience in systems administration, cloud engineering, and platform operations** who want to sharpen their concepts or prepare for mid‑senior technical interviews.

---

## 📚 Overview

This knowledge base compiles questions sourced from day‑to‑day operational scenarios across AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and general DevOps practices. It focuses on **clarity**, **accuracy**, and **practical troubleshooting**, rather than academic or theoretical explanations.

The content is organized as a flat Q&A list for simplicity and quick scanning. Future releases will introduce categorization, tagging, and interactive navigation.

---

## 📄 Contents Included in This Release

The following topics are covered:

* **AWS Networking & VPC Isolation**
* **Kubernetes Rollbacks, Upgrades, Operators, and Network Policies**
* **Terraform Import, Drift Management, and State Handling**
* **Cost Optimization Strategies in Cloud Environments**
* **Backup and Disaster Recovery Approaches**
* **VPC Connectivity Models**
* **Secrets Hygiene & Credential Rotation**

The full Q&A set is included in `devops-interview-questions.txt`.

## 🧩 Highlighted Themes

### 🔐 Cloud & Network Isolation

Covers VPC architecture design, subnet isolation, NACL usage, security groups, route tables, and advanced segmentation patterns (Transit Gateway, AWS Network Firewall).

### ☸️ Kubernetes Operations

Includes rollback strategies, cluster upgrade methodology, role of operators, admission controllers, and best practices for pod‑level network security.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Explains how to import existing resources, manage drift, reconcile state, and safely apply changes across environments.

### 💸 Cost Efficiency

Actionable guidance on leveraging autoscaling, spot instances, right‑sizing, serverless, and monitoring to drive compute cost reductions.

### 🔄 Backup & Restoration

Outlines Kubernetes backup tooling (Velero), AWS snapshot strategies, and PVC best practices for stateful workloads.
