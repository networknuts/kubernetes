DevOps Interview Questions








A curated list of essential DevOps interview questions covering AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Networking, CI/CD, and Cloud Architecture.

📌 1. How would you isolate a network within an AWS VPC?

Use public/private subnets, NACLs, security groups

Create dedicated subnets + restrictive route tables

Use AWS Network Firewall or Transit Gateway segmentation

📌 2. How do you handle rollbacks in Kubernetes?

kubectl rollout undo deployment/<name> --to-revision=<rev>

Keep previous ReplicaSets for rollback

Rollback automation via ArgoCD / Helm / Spinnaker

📌 3. Architectural differences between GCP VPC and AWS VPC
Feature	AWS VPC	GCP VPC
Scope	Regional	Global
Subnets	AZ-Based	Regional
Cross-VPC Communication	Requires peering	Built-in global communication
📌 4. What are Kubernetes Network Policies?

Firewall-like controls for pod-to-pod, pod-to-service, pod-to-external traffic

Works based on pod labels + IP rules

📌 5. What to do if creds are accidentally pushed to a repo?

Revoke/rotate credentials immediately

Clean history using git filter-repo or BFG Cleaner

Enable secrets scanning (GitGuardian, Trufflehog)

📌 6. How to import existing infra into Terraform state?
terraform import <resource_type>.<name> <resource_id>
terraform import aws_instance.myec2 i-123456


Then run terraform plan to align state

📌 7. How to upgrade a Kubernetes cluster?

Upgrade control plane

Upgrade worker nodes

Cordon + drain nodes

Replace or upgrade node groups

Always test in staging first

📌 8. How to reduce compute costs across an organization?

Auto Scaling

Reserved / Spot instances

Rightsize workloads

Use serverless (Lambda, Fargate)

Monitoring & resource cleanup

📌 9. How to connect two VPCs in AWS?

VPC Peering – simple, point-to-point

Transit Gateway – scalable hub

PrivateLink – service-level connectivity

📌 10. What is Terraform state drift?

Drift = manual infra changes outside Terraform

Detect using terraform plan

Fix by:

Applying Terraform

Importing external changes into state

📌 11. How to back up a Kubernetes cluster?

Velero for cluster + PVC backups

AWS Backup / snapshots for databases (RDS, EBS)

PVC volume snapshots for stateful workloads

📌 12. What are Kubernetes Operators?

Controllers extending K8s API using CRDs

Automate full app lifecycle

Examples: Prometheus Operator, MySQL Operator, ECK

📌 13. What are Kubernetes admission controllers?

Intercept API requests before they reach etcd

Validating: allow/deny

Mutating: modify requests

Use cases: security policies, sidecar injection, blocking privileged pods
