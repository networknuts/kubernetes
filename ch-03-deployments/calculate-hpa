For most cases, HPA is used with the trigger based on CPU usage. In this case, a good practice to define the target is:
		
	(CPU_LIMIT - safety) / (CPU_LIMIT + growth)

Where:

CPU_LIMIT: CPU limit is the usage limit on the pod. In most cases, the limit is 100%, but for node-pools that have a considerable percentage of idle resource, we can increase the limit.
safety: We don't want the resource to reach its limit, so we set a safety threshold.
growth: Percentage of traffic growth that we expect in a few minutes (say next 5 minutes).

  A practical example is an application where we set the limit at 100% usage for cpu, a safety threshold of 15% with an expected traffic growth of 30% in 5 minutes:

	(1 - 0.15) / (1 + 0.30) = 0.66

So the HPA would look something like this:

apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 66
